## Ionic Beacon

Implementation based on the article Support iBeacons In Your Ionic Framework Mobile App (https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/09/support-ibeacons-in-your-ionic-framework-mobile-app/).

## Ionic View App

Update Oct, 03 2016:
This code doesn't work on Ionic View App (http://view.ionic.io/) since it doesn't yet support ng-Cordova Beacon Plugin (http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/beacon/). For a complete list of Ionic View supported ng-Cordova plugins, see http://blog.petehouston.com/2016/01/21/list-of-supported-cordova-plugins-in-ionic-view/.
