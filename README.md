## Ionic Beacon

Implementation based on the article Support iBeacons In Your Ionic Framework Mobile App (https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/09/support-ibeacons-in-your-ionic-framework-mobile-app/).

### Ionic View App Not Supported

Update Oct, 03 2016:

- This code doesn't work on Ionic View App (http://view.ionic.io/) since Ionic View doesn't yet support ng-Cordova Beacon Plugin (http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/beacon/).
- For a complete list of Ionic View supported ng-Cordova plugins, see http://blog.petehouston.com/2016/01/21/list-of-supported-cordova-plugins-in-ionic-view/.
- If you want the Ionic Team to support ng-Cordova Beacon Plugin, make your request it in this issue: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-view-issues/issues/15#issuecomment-250482824.
